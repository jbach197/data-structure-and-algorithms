.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

Examples
.append(value)
Input	                           Args	  Output
head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X	 5	    head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> [5] -> X

.insertBefore(value, newVal)
Input	                            Args	  Output
head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X  	3, 5	  head -> [1] -> [5] -> [3] -> [2] -> X

.insertAfter(value, newVal)
Input	                            Args	  Output
head -> [1] -> [3] -> [2] -> X	  3, 5	  head -> [1] -> [3] -> [5] -> [2] -> X
